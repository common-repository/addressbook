A simple address book plugin.  View addresses in the admin back-end or embedded in a post or page.

== Description ==

A simple address book plugin.

You can view and edit addresses (names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, etc.) in the administration interface (under Manage > Addressbook or as its own top-level menu item), or embed a read-only list of addresses in posts and/or pages.

Addressbook features:

* Gravatar support for both address lists;
* hCard microformat support in the address list.

Still to come (hassle me if you want these now):

* Import/export to a bunch of formats;
* Firefox Operator addon scripts to export external addressed into Addressbook;
* Pass various options to the `<addressbook />` element, to sort and limit and whatnot;
* Templates for the address list display;
* Photo upload (probably over-ride the Gravatar, and show a note that there is a Gravatar?);
* Custom fields;

== Installation ==

# Upload the `addressbook` directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory ;
# Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress;
# You can embed a list of your addresses in a blog post or page by putting `<addressbook />` wherever you want the list to appear. The HTML generated by this conforms to the hCard microformat standard, which also means that you can fine-tune the appearance of the list via your theme's stylesheet.  The default presentation is pretty boring.

**Upgrading**

There is no need to de-activate and then re-activate Addressbook to upgrade.
